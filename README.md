Securify v2.0
===

Securify 2.0 is a security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts supported by the
[Ethereum
Foundation](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/)
and [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com). The core
[research](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/ccs18-securify.pdf)
behind Securify was conducted at the [Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH
Zurich.

It is the successor of the popular Securify security scanner (you can find the old version [here](https://github.com/eth-sri/securify)).


Features
===
- Supports 37 vulnerabilities (see [table](#supported-vulnerabilities) below)
- Implements novel context-sensitive static analysis written in Datalog
- Analyzes contracts written in Solidity >= 0.5.8


Docker
===
To build the container:
```angular2
sudo docker build -t securify .
```
To run the container:
````angular2
sudo docker run -it -v <contract-dir-full-path>:/share securify /share/<contract>.sol
````
Note: to run the code via Docker with a Solidity version that is different than `0.5.12`, you will need to modify the variable `ARG SOLC=0.5.12` at the top of the `Dockerfile` to point to your version. After building with the correct version, you should not run into errors.



Install
===

## Prerequisites
The following instructions assume that a Python is already installed. In addition to that, Securify requires `solc`, `souffle` and `graphviz` to be installed on the system:

### [Solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/installing-solidity.html) 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

### [Souffle](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install) 

Follow the instructions here: https://souffle-lang.github.io/download.html

*Please do not opt for the unstable version since it might break at any point.*

### [Graphviz / Dot](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)
```
sudo apt install graphviz
```

## Setting up the virtual environment

After the prerequisites have been installed, we can set up the python virtual environment from which we will run the scripts in this project. 

In the project's root folder, execute the following commands to set up and activate the virtual environment:

```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Verify that the `python` version is actually `3.7`:

```
python --version
```

Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```
cd <securify_root>/securify/staticanalysis/libfunctors
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`
```

Finally, install the project's dependencies by running the following commands from the `<securify_root>` folder:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Now you're ready to start using the securify framework.

Remember: Before executing the framework's scripts, you'll need to activate the virtual environment with the following command:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Usage
===

## Analyzing a contract
Currently Securify2 supports only flat contracts, i.e., contracts that do not contain import statements.

To analyze a local contract simply run:
```
securify <contract_source>.sol [--use-patterns Pattern1 Pattern2 ...]
```
Or download it from the Blockchain using the Etherscan.io API:
```
securify <contract_address> --from-blockchain [--key <key-file>]
```
*Notice that you need an API-key from Etherscan.io to use this functionality.*

To analyze a contract against specific severity levels run:
```
securify <contract_source>.sol [--include-severity Severity1 Severity2]
securify <contract_source>.sol [--exclude-severity Severity1 Severity2]
```
To get all the available patterns run:
```
securify --list
```

The following Slither patterns are not checked by Securify since they are checked by the Solidity compiler (ver. 0.5.8):
- `constant-function`
- `deprecated-standards`
- `pragma`

The following SWC vulnerabilities do not apply to Solidity contracts with pragma >=5.8 and are therefore not checked by Securify:

- SWC-118 (Incorrect Constructor Name)
- SWC-129 (Usage of +=)
